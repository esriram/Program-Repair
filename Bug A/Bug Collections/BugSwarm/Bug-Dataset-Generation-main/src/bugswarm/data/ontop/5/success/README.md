Compiling, packing, testing, etc.
--------------------
The project is a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project. Compiling, running the unit tests, building the release binaries all can be done using maven. To make it more practical we created several .sh scripts that you can run on any unix environment that has maven installed. The scripts are located in the folder 'scripts', look at that folder for more information.

Currently we use Maven 3 and Java 7 to build the project.

Code organization

The code is organized in several submodules as follows:
