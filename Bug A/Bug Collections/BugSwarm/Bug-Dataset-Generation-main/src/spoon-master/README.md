This uses spoon (https://github.com/INRIA/spoon) to comment code blocks by adding "// Start of If" and "// End of If" comments before and after an "if" statement for example. <br><br>
This works with:
- If 
- Else
- Else if
- Try
- Catch
- While
- For
- Foreach
- Switch
Statements <br><br>
Simply place all the java files in the "/test" directory and run ```./code.sh``` to comment and  ```./format.sh``` to format tabs with Google's Java formatting (https://github.com/google/google-java-format)
